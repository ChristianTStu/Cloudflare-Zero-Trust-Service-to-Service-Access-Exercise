# Cloudflare Zero Trust Service-to-Service Access Exercise

Welcome to the Cloudflare Zero Trust Service-to-Service Access Exercise repository. This project guides you through configuring service-to-service access within a Zero Trust Architecture using Cloudflare. Below, you will find the steps to set up the Cloudflare Zero Trust client and server on separate computers, and how to verify their connectivity.

## Overview of Cloudflare Zero Trust

Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform provides a secure framework to facilitate controlled access between services across different environments. Implementing service-to-service authentication and authorization ensures secure communication paths within your network infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a Cloudflare account and understand the basic concepts of Zero Trust security and service-oriented architectures.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Cloudflare Account:**
- If not already done, sign up for a free account at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). This will allow you to manage and implement Zero Trust policies.

2. **Install Cloudflare Zero Trust Client and Server:**
- Download and install the Cloudflare Zero Trust client on one computer.
- Set up the Cloudflare Zero Trust server on another computer. Ensure both installations are configured to communicate within your Cloudflare Zero Trust setup.

## Verification

3. **Configure Service-to-Service Access:**
- Configure the necessary Zero Trust policies in Cloudflare to allow secure communication between the client and server you have set up.

4. **Test Connectivity:**
- Test the connection between the two systems to ensure that the service-to-service communication is established and secure.

## Submission

5. **Capture and Submit Screenshots:**
- Take a screenshot of the Cloudflare dashboard showing the Zero Trust client and server configurations.
- Capture the policy settings that allow service-to-service access.
- Provide screenshots showing successful connectivity tests between the client and server.
